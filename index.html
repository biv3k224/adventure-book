                <p>Dear Mayalu,</p>
                <p>I hope you are doing well. I just wanted to write to you with all these honesty in my heart.</p>
                <p>Looking back, I realize how precious you are and how careless my mistake was. You gave so much love, trust, and effort into us, and I failed to value it the way you deserved. The truth is, the problem was never in you - it was in me.</p>
                <p>I carry a deep regret for hurting someone as beautiful as you - not just in looks, but in heart, mind and soul. You are rare, and you are precious. I wish I could have shown you more clearly how amazing you are through my eyes.</p>
                <p>I want you to know that your happiness and success will always mean everything to me. No matter where life takes you, I'll always silently wish the best for you - because loving you taught me what real love actually feels like.</p>
                <p>This mistake has changed me. It woke me up to parts of myself that I needed to fix, and I am growing because of it. I'm becoming a better man - not just for you, but for the future, for myself, and for anyone I may ever care about.</p>
                <p>If somewhere in your heart, you still believe in us, if there's even a small space left for me, I would be grateful for the chance to build trust again - slowly, patiently, and truly this time.(Haule Haule)</p>
                <p>But if not, I understand. And I will carry the love and lessons you gave me with respect and gratitude, always. Take care, my love. You are, and always will be, unforgettable to me.</p>
                <p>With all my my Heart,
                    Forever Yours,
                </p>
